Project Overview:

The user is building an automatic printing machine similar to a vending machine. The machine will feature an interactive app with multiple slides, guiding the user through a series of steps to print their documents. The process is as follows:

1. Starting screen (Slide 1): The app displays a gradient background with a centered circular logo and the text "Press any key to continue!" The user is prompted to press a key to move to the next slide.
2. File transfer via Bluetooth (Slide 2): The app will instruct the user to send a file to the machine via Bluetooth. The screen will show the message "Send the file via Bluetooth" and "Name: InstaPrintMachine" at the bottom of the screen.
3. User selects print settings (Slide 3): After receiving the file, the user will choose print settings, such as:
    
    Paper size (e.g., long or short bond paper)
    Color settings (colored or black and white)
    Number of copies to print

4. Cost and payment details (Slide 4): The app will display the user's paper settings along with the payment amount.
5. Printing process (Slide 5): Once payment is made, the machine will begin printing.

Hardware Integration:

The system will also involve connecting a microcontroller to handle payment processing and control other hardware components. The machine needs to interface with various peripherals, including payment systems and Bluetooth communication.

Programming Mentorship Request:
The user has no prior programming experience and seeks mentorship to help with coding this project, particularly focusing on the app interface (using Tkinter) and the integration with hardware components like Bluetooth and payment systems. The user requests detailed and accurate answers for each question related to the project.
