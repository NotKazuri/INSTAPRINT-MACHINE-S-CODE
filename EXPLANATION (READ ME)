The machine is a self-service printing kiosk that combines a Python-based app with physical hardware. Users interact with the 
app to select a file and view the cost, after which they are prompted to insert coins into a coin slot. The coin slot records
each coin and communicates with the system to ensure the required payment is met, making the process user-friendly and straightforward.

Once the necessary payment is received, the system processes the file—possibly converting it into a printer-friendly
format—and sends it to the printer to produce a hard copy. A microcontroller is used to manage communication 
between the app and the hardware, ensuring smooth operation. After printing, the machine resets, clearing temporary
data and preparing for the next user, thereby creating a seamless and automated workflow.
